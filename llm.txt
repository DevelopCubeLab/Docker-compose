o The used LLM tool
  c¡¢ChatGPT 4o and 4o mini

o Motivation/reason to use LLM
  When I finished building the program, I couldn't run my program in the docker container, I tried to use ChatGPT to seek solutions, and they provided some solutions.

o How and why LLM helped
  chatGPT told me that I needed to create a network interface for the two services to communicate, which was different from the address of my computer. I modified the Dockerfile.

o What kind of mistakes LLM did
  LLM asked me to modify the code and always change different methods in the code, but I found through testing that I only needed to install the ps command package in the container to work properly.

o What were things that LLM was not able to provide
  LLM cannot replace my thinking. I prefer to build my program concisely enough, but LLM will make the program complicated, which I think is unnecessary.
